   Paul E. Zurek, Jr., of Salem, New Hampshire and formerly of Reading, passed away unexpectedly on Sunday, October 2, 2016, after completing a half marathon with his wife in Hampton, NH, at age 36. 

Paul was born in Stoneham on June 11, 1980, and raised and educated in Reading. He graduated from Reading High School, Class of 1998 where he played hockey, made many lifelong friends, and met his future wife, Jenessa. He continued his education and hockey career at Assumption College where he graduated with a Bachelor's Degree. Paul and Jenessa started dating after a first kiss on Long Beach, remained devoted to each other through college, and were married at St. Patrick Church in Stoneham on August 4th 2007. 

Settling in Salem, NH, Paul was completely committed to Jenessa, his two young sons, Nathan and Cameron, and touched the lives of everyone he encountered in life. Recently Paul found a position in medical device sales at Medtronic where he felt he could make a difference. Paul had an innate goodness a genuine kindness that made a lasting impact on those around him. Working in the medical field, he was grateful for the opportunity to know he was helping people. Wherever he was, he was always eager to help, and offered unconditional support and friendship to anyone he met, including family, friends, strangers and even animals. 

After buying their first home, Paul arrived home and surprised Jenessa with a Chiapoo named "Callie." Callie became part of the family, and another great friend of Paul's. He loved playing hockey, rooting for the Bruins, and going to Foxboro for snowy Patriots games with his longtime buddies. Paul recently said that he was put on this earth to be a great father to Nathan and Cameron, and he did everything he could to make that happen. He and Jenessa made a beautiful home for their family, with Paul working hard on home improvements, or entertaining the boys. Together they loved tractor rides while mowing the lawn, playing street hockey, trips to Peach Tree Farm for ice cream, or ice skating lessons. Paul knew it was important to Jenessa that the boys learn to swim, so he built a pool in the backyard to teach the boys. He adored Nathan and Cameron, and wanted to be the best Dad he could be. He and Jenessa shared a devotion and love for one another. Among many happy memories, they enjoyed frequent runs, nights out to dinner at his favorite restaurant, Grassfields in N. Andover, and summer weekends spent in Brewster on Cape Cod. 

Paul worked hard at everything he did in life. His family, his friends, his career, and his boys meant the world to him. He was above all, a dedicated and loving husband, son, father and brother with a tough exterior but kind, gentle and caring spirit. The Zurek and Lanigan families, together with Paul's extended family and friends, mourn his tragic loss, but the imprint he has left behind on his two young sons remains as his legacy. 

Paul was the beloved husband of Jenessa R. (Lanigan) Zurek with whom he shared 9 years of marriage. Devoted and loving father of Nathan and Cameron Zurek. Treasured son of Bette Adams Burke and her husband Joseph of Reading, and Paul E. Zurek of FL. Dear son-in-law of Deb and Rick Lanigan of Reading. Cherished brother of Patrick Zurek, Madeline Burke, Michelle Burke, and brother-in-law of Ryan Lanigan and Jillene Lanigan, all of Reading.

Newbury, Corrine Adams-Kimball and her husband Phil of Byfield, Susan Adams Campbell and her husband Paul of Brooklyn, Samuel Adams, Jr. and his wife Genna of Eagle, CO, Nancy McClorey and her husband Steven of Melrose, Linda Adams Penney of Manchester, NH, and Amy Adams Barry and her husband Tom of E.
