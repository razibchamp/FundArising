    Since I first contacted Kesha several months ago, we have been working together to try and find the best way to move forward with this campaign. We didn't raise enough to accomplish our initial goal of buying Kesha's contract, and Kesha didn't want to accept the money for herself. She wanted to find a way to help others, and she wanted to make sure your donations were put to use in a way that would honor each and every one of you who gives.

So with Kesha's blessing and support, all of the money raised by this campaign will be given to RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network) to help fund their National Sexual Assault Hotline as well as educational outreach efforts. This way, your donations will go directly towards helping survivors.

When you give to RAINN, you're not just donating to an organization—you're helping to improve the lives of thousands of people affected by sexual violence. 93¢ of every dollar donated will go directly to RAINN's programs and services. RAINN will use this donation to help an average of 558 survivors receive help through its hotlines each day. A portion of the funds also will be used to educate more than 130 million people per year on prevention and recovery, through relationships with the entertainment industry, the media, and local communities.
