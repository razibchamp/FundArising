My story begins with numbness. One day in 2012, three of the fingers in my left hand suddenly lost their feeling. My family—me, my wife, Rahi, and our four sons—were living in Dhaka at the time, and I made an appointment to see a doctor right away. The feeling was restored by the time my physician could see me, but Rahi convinced me to proceed with the appointment. I had an X-ray to see if the spine showed any signs of damage, perhaps from truck driving. When some suspicious spots turned up on the film, my doctor recommended an MRI of my brain.

The MRI set off alarm bells. The image showed lesions in my brain and a large mass at the front. My doctor urged me to see a neurologist immediately. After several tests, the neurologist thought I had multiple sclerosis, or MS, which as I understand, may look similar to cancer.

Wanting to know all of our options, my wife and I decided to seek a second opinion. Again, after several tests, the second neurologist also felt I had MS. Rehana and I decided we would follow the doctor’s suggestion that I begin treatment.

Life calmed down for a time. I started taking medication for MS and saw my neurologist regularly. But three years later, things took a turn. We had just moved to Rajshahi because my mother was sick and we wanted to be near her. My prescription needed to be renewed, 
and the doctor I saw wanted to do a new MRI to make sure that my condition was not progressing. At that time, my scans didn’t show that I had MS, but a possibility of cancer. She wanted to me to see a neurosurgeon in Dhaka right away. During my first visit with the neurosurgeon, Rahi and I felt concerned. The doctor confirmed that I had brain cancer and told me that it could be removed with a surgical procedure. I was panicking. I was going to have brain surgery. The thought of this was very scary. I was scared; Rahi was scared.
We did have some money then the cost of cancer is much more than our ability.My treatment began and the treatment process is so much painful.I had the surgery in November 2015, and the next day, I felt that my fingers and toes worked just fine. I walked out of the ICU. We spent three days at a hotel, and everything went smoothly. My neurosurgeon was confident that he’d removed the cancer entirely. And in doing so, I felt he’d left behind barely any sign of an operation. The incision was as minimal as possible. My head was shaved a tiny bit, 
but it was barely noticeable if I combed my hair the right way. And when interacting with me, my neurosurgeon was honest and straightforward, but also warm and caring.But the treatment process is much costly which my family can't afford now.I don't know what to do.I would like to ask all of you to help me with what u can afford.It's my last request.Maybe I won't be alive in near future and my family will lost me because of money costs if u people don't help me in my bad days..
