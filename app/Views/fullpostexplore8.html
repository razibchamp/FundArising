     In August 2015, when I was 53 years old, I was still grieving the loss of my father, who had died of heart disease the prior November. I suppose I was tuned into more physical matters of the heart at that time too. One day, while I was washing my hands in the bathroom, the light was hitting my neck in just the right way and I noticed a bump. My first thought was there was something wrong with my arteries. I showed the bump to my husband and he took me to the emergency room at a hospital near our home in Shawnee, Kansas.

At the hospital, X-rays were taken and the doctor told me to return the next morning for a CT scan. There was a small mass visible in the X-ray, but the doctors weren’t sure what it was; a CT scan would provide a clearer view. When I returned the next morning, one person after another told me I needed two different scans because the radiologist had noticed a spot on my lung when he looked at my X-ray the previous night.

After the CT scans were completed, the doctor informed me I had cancer. He had already talked to my family doctor, who had said for me to go straight to him from the hospital. My family doctor then sent me immediately to a lung specialist. I ended up seeing three doctors about my diagnosis before I even saw my family.

The lung specialist sent me to a surgeon for a biopsy. After that, I went to a local oncologist, who told me the results of the biopsy. There was cancer in my left lung that had spread to lymph nodes and the center of my chest and neck. The spread of cancer to my lymph nodes was what I had spotted on my neck. The doctor told me I had stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.
At the time I was diagnosed, my husband and I had our own business. An employee told us he knew someone who had been treated for cancer at Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA) in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I called CTCA before I started treatment at a local facility, and learned about TomoTherapy (a radiation treatment), integrative care and other things they offered. The care at CTCA sounded wonderful, but I would need to be away from my home and family for treatment. I decided I did not want to spend time away from my family.

I began treatment with the local oncologist, but was not satisfied with the treatment. So I called CTCA. A team of doctors reviewed my information and agreed to take me. Within days, my husband and I were on our way to CTCA in Tulsa.

After a week of testing and initial appointments with my care team at CTCA, we returned home. I then drove back so that I’d have a car with me during the weeks of radiation treatment I was to receive. Fortunately I was able to have a rotating roster of family and friends with me the entire time I was at CTCA, which had the added bonus of giving me a lot of extra quality time with my loved ones.

During those first seven weeks, I had radiation five days a week and chemotherapy once weekly. For three months afterward, I returned to CTCA every three weeks for chemotherapy.

After the disease was stabilized for four months, I had another round of chemotherapy. I was given a targeted therapy drug called erlotinib for maintenance therapy that I have been taking for several years. More recently, my doctors at CTCA found a spot on my right lung and I received CyberKnife® radiation therapy.But the treatment is so much expensive.All the money is finished now.Now we are totally empty handed.My family and me don't know what to do next to survive.I need help now from others to save my life.
